                <p>Yes this is worth cost of admission if you care about kitchen styling. If you are utilitarian and only want the product to function daily, this may be too expensive for your use.</p>

                <p>As beautiful as expected! Though pricy, the quality is what you pay for. It comes with good presentation and packaging. Also, it is bigger than I expected!</p>
