                <p>Yes this is worth cost of admission if you care about kitchen styling. If you are utilitarian and only want the product to function daily, this may be too expensive for your use.</p>

                <p>As beautiful as expected! Though pricy, the quality is what you pay for. It comes with good presentation and packaging. Also, it is bigger than I expected!</p>

                <p>I am on my THIRD Smeg toaster in a month because each and every one burns toast on any setting other than 1. Here is my complaint letter for the second toaster, and the last toaster that arrived has performed just as poorly as the first two. They evidently have ZERO quality control, or inspections before shipping to the consumer.</p>
